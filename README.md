# Test-Scores
C++ program that utilizes dynamic memory allocation, pointer notation, and a sorting algorithm to store and process student grades


This program utilizes pointer notation and dynamic memory allocation to
calculate the average test score from data stored in an array. The user inputs the
number of students in the class, then an array is declared by dynamic memory allocation.
A sorting algorithm is utilized to sort the elements in the array into ascending order.
The individual scores and final class average are then displayed in table format.
